Basic Obstacle Avoidance Robot
When the program starts, the motor speed will be set to half, 
and the robot will start moving forward. 
If the distance sensor detects an obstacle within 15 cm, the robot will stop and rotate to the right. 
If it doesn't detect anything within the range, it will keep going; otherwise, it will rotate to the left, and so on.
Pseudocode: 

START
# Initialize the motor speed to half
SET motor_speed TO half
# Start moving the robot forward
MOVE_FORWARD(motor_speed)
LOOP forever
    # Read the distance from the distance sensor
    distance = READ_DISTANCE_SENSOR()
    # Check if there is an obstacle within 15 cm
    IF distance < 15 cm THEN
        # Stop the robot
        STOP()
        # Rotate the robot to the right
        ROTATE_RIGHT()
        # Resume moving forward
        MOVE_FORWARD(motor_speed)
    ELSE
        # Keep moving forward
        MOVE_FORWARD(motor_speed)
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP
